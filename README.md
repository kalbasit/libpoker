This project is meant for educational use only.

I find it much more intuitive to learn a language by solving a challenging
mathematical problem. It allows you to explore the language in ways books
can't. One of my favorite problem to solve, is to score a hand of Texas Hold'em
poker game as fast as possible. This allowed me, for example, to learn both
Ruby and Ruby C-bindings to write an optimized solution.

Please read the following articles for more information on the problem itself:
